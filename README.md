# Recommender_System

This is a project for the course "Recommender System". The project is to build a recommender system for the movie dataset [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 5, but we only use the binary ratings (1 if the rating is larger than 3, 0 otherwise) in this project.
